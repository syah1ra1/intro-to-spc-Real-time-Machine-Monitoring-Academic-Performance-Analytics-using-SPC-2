### Process Capability Analysis: PartLength (Machine 2 & 3)

This analysis assesses the ability of Machine 2 and Machine 3 to produce 'PartLength' within specified limits when operating at 338K and 200kPa.

**Specification Limits:**
- Lower Specification Limit (LSL): 45
- Upper Specification Limit (USL): 55

**Machine 2 Key Capability Metrics:**
- Cp (Process Capability Index): N/A
- Cpk (Process Capability Index, adjusted for centering): N/A

**Machine 3 Key Capability Metrics:**
- Cp (Process Capability Index): N/A
- Cpk (Process Capability Index, adjusted for centering): N/A

_Note: A Cp/Cpk value greater than 1.33 generally indicates a capable process._

::: {.column width="50%"}
_The process capability plots for Machine 2 and Machine 3 generated by R's `qcc` package would typically be displayed here as static images, as direct interactive HTML export is not straightforward. The R code for this analysis has been saved to `media/plots/partlength_pca_machine2.md` and `media/plots/partlength_pca_machine3.md`._
